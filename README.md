# A Frida script to bypass SSL pinning in Instagram (iOS)

See [FAQ](docu/README.md) for details.

**Warning!** If something does not work, try to fix it yourself or just forget about it. I take a look at this GitHub account from time to time ( ==once a year) and support the script in my spare time ( ==never), so the pain you feel while using the script is  100% yours.
